Environment Variables
=====================
These environment variables are needed for the django app to function. Without them, its behavior may either be
unpredictable or be non-functional. You may set them in pretty much any way you wish. They are imported via python's
os.getenv() function. Documentation here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html

For a full overview of django settings, many of which are found in use below, see:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/settings/

| **DEBUG**: boolean. If this is missing, the default is FALSE.

| **DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS**: a comma-separated list of IP addresses or hostnames.

| **DJANGO_SECRET_KEY**: Choose a very strong password to help protect the web app. If missing, django will generate a new key every time it starts. This will invalidate every session each time it starts.

| **MYSQL_HOST**: The hostname or IP address of your MYSQL server (Does not fully support pooling at this time)

| **MYSQL_PORT**: The port that your MYSQL server is listening for MYSQL connections.

| **MYSQL_USERNAME**: The username with at least CREATE, ALTER, INSERT, SELECT, DELETE, and UPDATE on the reminders database.

| **MYSQL_PASSWORD**: The password to the user account in MYSQL_USERNAME

| **DISCORD_CLIENT_ID**: Your discord app's client ID. See: https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2

| **DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI**: The redirect URI you provide discord to return OAUTH2 requests back to.

| **DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET**: The secret generated for you by discord for your app.

| **DISCORD_AUTH_URL**: The auth url generated by discord using your redirect uri.

| **DISCORD_SERVER_INVITE_LINK**: A link for users to join a common server with the bot.

| **DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL**: A link to a webhook the bot can see to receive signals such as refreshing channel lists or testing messages.

| **REGISTRATIONS_ENABLED**: When False, only existing users can use the platform. If a user deletes their data, they won't be able to log back in. Default is False.

| **DJANGO_LOGGING_LEVEL**: Set to a level of logging in the python logging library, such as ERROR, WARNING, INFO, or DEBUG
