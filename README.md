## CinnamonSwirl WebApp
****
This allows you to see, create, edit and delete reminders for the Discord bot [CinnamonSwirl](https://github.com/CinnamonSwirly/CinnamonSwirl).

It's not meant to be standalone. This was made as a learning experience to explore the basics of Django and thus, 
may be missing a lot of features some would consider mandatory. It is provided as-is under the Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal license.

### Requirements
* MariaDB or MySQL instance, can be a container or standalone. Cloud instances not tested.
* A registered Discord application. Can be the same as the one you use for the Discord bot.
* If building with the attached dockerfile, only docker 20.10.12 or higher is required to build the project.
* If running without docker, the following are required:
  * Python 3.10 or greater
  * The following python libraries:
